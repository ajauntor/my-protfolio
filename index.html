            <h3>A front-end Developer</h3>
            <p>I have a strong passion for the discipline that goes into front-end development. Keeping in mind scalability and clean code that is maintainable and readable. My main activity is play with different type of code like HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Node js, React Js etc. Often, I have to rewrite code in a different languages, so that programs and applications can be compatible with different operating systems. For example, Windows and OS X programs are coded differently. Sometimes I trained to write new applications in SaaS code, which works across both operating paltform. </p>

            <h3>Become full stack developer</h3>
            <p>Similar to marketing, this goal measures the ability of a website to sell (convert a website visitor into a customer). It is typically measured as a percentage of website visitors who become paying customers. This goal is suited best for e-commerce/SaaS websites that want to focus specifically on maximizing a website’s ability to sell. This goal can also help measure changes in the quality of traffic. Just as with marketing KPIs, it is absolutely crucial to know your website’s current conversion rates before setting this goal. Example: Increase the website’s conversion rate by 5% (with the same amount of traffic).</p>

    <h3>A front-end Developer</h3>
    <p>I have a strong passion for the discipline that goes into front-end development. Keeping in mind scalability and clean code that is maintainable and readable. My main activity is play with different type of code like HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Node js, React Js etc. Often, I have to rewrite code in a different languages, so that programs and applications can be compatible with different operating systems. For example, Windows and OS X programs are coded differently. Sometimes I trained to write new applications in SaaS code, which works across both operating systems.  </p>
